## 📌 Project Overview

Event cameras represent a new paradigm in vision sensing, capturing asynchronous changes in a scene at microsecond resolution. This hands-on lab introduces the basics of working with event-based data and provides practical exercises for:

- Understanding event streams vs. frame-based vision
- Reading and visualizing event data
- Frame reconstruction from event streams
- Motion and intensity change detection using event flow
- Comparing event-based and traditional vision approaches
